### Key Changes Needed:
1. **Personal Branding**: Replace references to "Tw93" with your own name and identity. For example, update `README.md`, `index.html`, and any project description that mentions "Tw93".
2. **Directory Name**: Update `tw93-tw93/` to something like `himanshu-portfolio/`.
3. **Image and Links**: Replace external references such as `https://static.tw93.fun/pic/1.png` with your own hosted images or links.
4. **Dynamic Sections**: In `build_readme.py`, adapt the data sources (`graphql`, `rss.xml`, `feed.xml`) to fetch your project's releases, blog posts, and inspirations.
5. **Languages and Skills**: Update mentions of "Swift / Rust" in `index.html` to reflect your skillset, like Python, JavaScript, or other tools.
6. **Scripts**: Modify `fetch_weekly`, `fetch_releases`, and `fetch_blog_entries` to source content related to your blog or project feeds.

Would you like me to edit these files for you, or should I assist with specific parts of this process?
